"""Note about datetime.

I find this module super confusing. The module called datetime defines classes called
date and datetime, and the class datetime defines a method called date. Therefore, if
you do `import datetime` and then type `datetime.date`, you get the class date, which
is the correct one for typing dates. If you do `from datetime import datetime` and then
type `datetime.date`, you get the method, which isn't the correct one for typing dates.
My solution is to import the classes date and datetime from the module. Also note that
dataclasses-json doesn't support encoding or decoding of datetime.date into JSON, so
functions need to be defined explicitly for that purpose.

class Participant(_SerialisationMixin, _ParReqFieldsMixin):
    """Participant dataclass.

    This is the dataclass for participants. Users should create an instance of this class
    (or one of its subclasses) for each participant in an experiment prior to creating
    the experiment instance.

    Participant objects have one required field called `participant_id`, which must be
    unique for each participant. Users are forced to specify this field when creating a
    participant object, and an error is raised if the ID already belongs to someone else
    (i.e., there is already a participant file with the same ID in the participant
    directory).

    There are two reasons to re-use a participant ID: (1) the same participant is about
    to start a second experiment or resume a paused experiment; and (2) the participant
    ID was used previously in error. If (1), the user must load the previously saved
    participant object rather than create a new object. If (2), the erroneous saved file
    should be deleted. Please note that under no circumstances can a participant repeat
    an experiment they previously completed.

    There are several optional fields that can be added to the participant dataclass:

        dob: Date of birth. Should be a `date` object.
        age: Age. Should be an `int` or `float`. Doesn't make sense to use this if `dob`
            is specified.
        gender: Participant gender.
        language: Participant language. Should be a language and region code.
        comments: Any comments about the participant.
        group: Participant group.

    These do not appear in the repr or str methods, but they are saved to the JSON file.
    If you want to add additional fields, you can do so by creating a subclass:

    ```python
    @dataclass
    class MyParticipant(Participant):
        my_field: int: 0
    ```

    Unfortunately, you have to specify default values for the new fields, even if you
    want them to be required. You can define required fields, but it is a bit cumbersome
    (sorry). You either need to overload the `__post_init__()` method to perform a check
    that the required field doesn't match the default value or use a mixin. There are
    examples in the code base. Personally, I would just live with using default values.

    Participant objects check all that participant IDs are unique in all subclasses. This
    means that you can't have `Participant(participant_id="test")` and
    `SomeSubclassParticipant(participant_id="test")`. This is a good thing!

    Participant objects have `save()`, `load()`, `to_json()` and `from_json()`methods for
    serialisation.

    This class is not meant to be instantiated directly. Instead, it is subclassed by
    the Experiment and Trial classes (and their subclasses), adding status functionality.
    `status` is a special property that can only be one of a few values and can be
    changed from one value to another only in certain ways. The `status` setter performs
    these checks and other actions, such as updating the `status_history` list. The value
    of `status` is mirrored in the `current_status` field.

    Fields:
        current_status: What is the current status of the experiment or trial?
        status_history: A list of dictionaries containing the status and the datetime
            at which the status was set.
        event_history: A blank list for users to add events to.
        datetime_started: When did the experiment or trial start?
        datetime_finished: When did the experiment or trial finish?
        datetimes_paused: A list of tuples containing the start and end datetimes of
            each pause.
        datetime_last_paused: When was the experiment or trial last paused?
        duration: How long did the experiment or trial last?

    Properties:

    This is the base dataclass for trials. Users should create an instance of this class

    Trial dataclasses have several optional user-specifiable fields:

        reaction_time: The time taken to respond.

    Trials also contain several automatically managed fields that should not be changed

    """Experiment dataclass.

    This is the dataclass for experiments. Users should create an instance of this class
    (or one of its subclasses) each time a new participant is about to run an experiment,
    ideally after creating the corresponding participant object.

    Experiment objects have two user-specifiable fields: `participant_id` and
    `experiment_id`. The combination of these IDs must be unique. In other words, a
    single participant can perform multiple different experiments, and multiple
    participants can perform the same experiment, but the same participant cannot perform
    the same experiment more than once (this is the "golden rule" of expflow).

    Users are forced to specify both fields when creating an experiment object, and an
    error is raised if the combination already exists (i.e., there is already an
    experiment file with the same ID combination in the experiment directory).

    There are two reasons to re-use an ID combination: (1) a participant is about to
    resume a paused experiment; and (2) a participant or experiment ID was used
    previously in error. If (1), the user must load the previously saved experiment
    object rather than create a new object. If (2), the erroneous saved file should be
    deleted. Again, under no circumstances can a participant repeat an experiment they
    previously completed.

    If you want to add additional fields to the experiment dataclass, you can do so
    by subclassing this class and adding the additional fields. However, I don't think it
    makes sense to do this, since it is usually the participant and/or trials where
    extra specific information is desirable. On the other hand, users may want to
    subclass the experiment dataclass to modify the experimental logic, but this is not
    covered here.

    Like participant objects, experiment objects have serialisation methods. They also
    have several extra automatically managed fields. The most important one is
    `current_status`, which keeps track of the trial's progress in the context of the
    experiment. Expflow performs several checks whenever this field is changed to ensure
    that the experiment object is being used correctly. There is also a `status_history`
    field that records the history of changes to the `current_status` field.

    Another useful automatically managed field is `duration`, which is the total time
